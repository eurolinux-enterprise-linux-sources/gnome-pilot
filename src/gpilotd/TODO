Add a command line switch to specify the pid file

support conduit paths

Write the global version of gpilotd

Add the application protocol support

Fix the code that detects when user has pressed hotsync.  It currently
forks whenever a serial event occurs(So it forks when the pilot is
placed on the cradle).  This is bad due to resources, things will
still work because of pilot-link's timeouts.  Doing this will probably
take modifications to the pilot-link library to have a function to see
if a hotsync was requested, and if so continue it, if not return.  For
now things work OK.

Add locking to the write_sync_stamp code so two sync's for the same
users pilots don't clobber each other.

Clean up the code a bit. :)

Make gpilotd honor the archive bits of the DB.

CORBA part:
- monitor_on/off aren't implemented
- when responding, and cb object is lost, remove from notify
  list
- remember notify objects across restarts ?
