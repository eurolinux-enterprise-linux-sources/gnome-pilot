Passwords
---------

To set a password for a user, run utils/gnome-pilot-make-password
/dev/cua?, press sync and you'll get an encrypted password.

Add the encrypted password to the pilot, in the form of

[Pilotxxx]
...
password=<encryptedpasswordhere>

Note: the encryption is done by calling crypt on the already encrypted
password in the pilot.  Verification is done be using the pilots
password as an "cleartext" password.  Therefore if your encrypted
pilotpassword is snooped, this password can be faked easily.  This
implementation is a proof-of-concept workaround of issues raised by
Dr. Mike. I'm looking at implementing a more secure system, if I can
find someway to verify a cleartext password against the pilots
encrypted.
